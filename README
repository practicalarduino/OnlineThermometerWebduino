Install temperature sensors around your home or office and access an
up-to-the-moment report using a web browser. Readings can also be
logged and graphed over time.

This is an updated version of the project designed to work with
Ethernet shields based on the Wiznet W5100 chipset, such as the
official Arduino Ethernet shield and the Freetronics Ethernet shield.
